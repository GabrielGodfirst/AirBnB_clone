# AirBnB_clone

## Description of the Project

The **AirBnB_clone** project is a simplified clone of the AirBnB
web application. This command-line interface (CLI) application allows
users to manage objects related to the AirBnB platform, such as users,
places, and reviews. The project is built using Python and is designed to be
modular, making it easy to extend and maintain.

The primary goal of this project is to implement a simple command interpreter 
to manage the AirBnB objects. Users can create, update, delete, and retrieve
object instances directly from the command line.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is the core component of the AirBnB_clone project.
It allows users to interact with the application via the terminal or
command prompt.

### How to Start It

To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AirBnB_clone.git

## Navigating to the project directory

2. ** Navigating to the project directory
	cd AirBnB_clone

3. ** Make ommand interpreter executable:***
	chmod +x command_interpreter.py

4. ** Run the command interpreter:**
	./command_interpreter.py

5. ** Create a new object**
	(cmd) create user
6. ** Show details of an object**
	(cmd) show User 1234-5678-9012

7. ** Update an object's attribute: **
	(cmd) update User 1234-5678-9012 name "John Doe"

8. ** Delete an object: **
	(cmd) delete User 1234-5678-9012

9. ** Exit the interpreter: **
	(cmd) quit
